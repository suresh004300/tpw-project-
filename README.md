Abstract
Stress is a growing concern in contemporary society, significantly impacting individuals' mental and physical health. Early detection of stress plays a crucial role in enhancing well-being and preventing health complications. This paper presents a comparative study of two machine learning classifiers—Random Forest and Naive Bayes—for the detection of stress levels based on physiological parameters such as body temperature, steps taken, humidity, heart rate, and sleep duration. To address the inherent class imbalance in the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed, ensuring an equal distribution across stress levels. Experimental results demonstrate that Random Forest outperforms Naive Bayes, achieving an accuracy of 83.18% compared to 71.05%. Additionally, a Streamlit-based web application was developed to facilitate real-time stress predictions. Future enhancements may involve model fine-tuning and the inclusion of additional physiological features to further improve accuracy and applicability.
